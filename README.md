 The world of blockchain technology is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with digital assets.

In this evolving landscape, a new Ethereum token standard called ERC-404 has emerged, capturing the imaginations of developers and investors alike.


This "semi-fungible" standard promises to bridge the gap between traditional fungible (ERC-20) and non fungible tokens (ERC-721), unlocking exciting new possibilities for ownership and trading.

ERC-404 represents an experimental token standard exploring the concept of semi-fungibility further.

Unlike ERC-20 tokens, which are entirely fungible, and ERC-721 tokens, which are completely non-fungible, ERC-404 tokens aim to strike a balance between fungibility and non-fungibility.

 In other words, ERC-404 tokens possess both fungible and non-fungible properties, offering developers a flexible framework for tokenization,

I have created the ERC-404 smart contract and deployed it to the Sepoile test network. check it to verify the smart contract address link here.

// For run this one project do this//
i have create this one smart contract and using harhdat tool and verify this one smart contract in Etherescan .
